# PythonApp
Should be as simple as going to the happylabels folder and clicking on the HappyLabels.exe ... 
it should have all packages and python itself wrapped up in that folder so nothing else needs to be downloaded.

You can see the packages yourself it you check out the requirements.txt and how to build it yourself in python in the readme.txt file ... so gl 
works just like the word document just less code for me to debug
